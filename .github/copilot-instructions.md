# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository is a Go implementation of a Jira CLI (`jcli`) used by developers to interact with Jira from the command line. The CLI supports operations such as creating, updating, searching, and transitioning issues, managing projects, sprints, and boards, and discovering metadata about a Jira instance.

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation is **mandatory** in this codebase. Every file, every exported symbol, and every non-trivial unexported symbol must have a comment. These are not optional - the codebase is a teaching reference.

The documentation must be clear, concise, and informative. It should explain the purpose of the code, how it works, and any important details that a reader would need to understand it. Use Go's standard doc comment format (`// ...`) and avoid using em-dashes or other non-standard punctuation.

The command line help, SKILL.md and README.md must always be consistent with the code and with each other. If you change the name of a command, flag, or environment variable in the code, update the documentation in all three places to match.

Never use the em-dash character "-".

### Package (file-level) comments

Every `.go` file must begin with a `// Package ...` doc comment before the `package` declaration.

The package comment must explain:
1. **What** this package/service does in one sentence
2. **Why** it exists - its role in the overall architecture
3. **How** it fits in - what it connects to, what protocol/pattern it uses
4. Any non-obvious design decisions or trade-offs

Use Go's standard `//` doc comment format. For multi-section package docs, use `#` headings inside the comment block:

```go
// Package client provides the HTTP client used by all jcli commands to
// communicate with the Jira REST API v2.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE PACKAGE?
// Keeping the HTTP layer separate from the command layer means commands can
// be tested without making real network calls, and the client can be reused
// across commands without duplicating request logic.
//   - All API calls go through the single Client type, which holds the base
//     URL, credentials, and a shared http.Client.
//   - Error responses are decoded into a structured JiraError type so callers
//     get actionable messages rather than raw status codes.
package client
```

### Function and method comments

Every exported function, method, type, constant, and variable must have a doc comment starting with the symbol name:

```go
// GetIssue fetches a single issue by key from the Jira REST API.
// The fields returned depend on the Jira instance configuration; use
// --output json to inspect the full response.
func (c *Client) GetIssue(ctx context.Context, key string) (*Issue, error) {
```

For unexported functions, add a comment when the logic is non-obvious, the function has important preconditions, or it plays a significant architectural role:

```go
// buildJQL constructs a JQL query string from the supplied filter options.
// An empty filter returns an empty string, which Jira treats as "all issues".
func buildJQL(f IssueFilter) string {
```

Short unexported helpers (< 5 lines, name is self-explanatory) do not need a comment:

```go
func boolPtr(b bool) *bool { return &b }
```

### Struct and type comments

Every exported struct must explain its purpose, its concurrency safety (if relevant), and any important invariants:

```go
// Client is the HTTP client used to communicate with the Jira REST API.
// It holds the base URL, credentials, and a shared http.Client instance.
//
// Client is safe for concurrent use. Create one instance at startup and
// share it across all commands.
type Client struct {
```

Every exported struct field must have an inline comment explaining what it stores, what units it uses, and any constraints:

```go
// Issue represents a Jira issue as returned by GET /rest/api/2/issue/{key}.
type Issue struct {
    // Key is the human-readable issue identifier, e.g. "PROJ-123".
    Key string `json:"key"`

    // Fields contains all field values for the issue. The exact set of fields
    // depends on the Jira project configuration and the fields query parameter.
    Fields IssueFields `json:"fields"`
}
```

### Constants and variables

Group related constants with a `const (...)` block. Comment the block and each constant:

```go
const (
    // apiBase is the path prefix for all Jira REST API v2 endpoints.
    // Prepended to every request path inside Client methods.
    apiBase = "/rest/api/2"

    // agileBase is the path prefix for Jira Agile (board/sprint) endpoints.
    agileBase = "/rest/agile/1.0"
)
```

Sentinel errors must have comments explaining when they are returned and what the caller should do:

```go
// ErrNotFound is returned when the Jira API responds with HTTP 404.
// The caller should check whether the issue key or project key is correct.
var ErrNotFound = errors.New("resource not found")
```

### Inline comments

Use inline comments to explain **why**, not **what**. The code already says what it does.

```go
// Good: explains the reason for the special case
if status == 204 {
    return nil // 204 No Content is a success with no body to decode
}

// Bad: restates what the code already says
if status == 204 {
    return nil // return nil
}
```

Use section dividers with `// -----------------------------------------------------------------------` to break long files into logical sections. This is the established convention in this codebase:

```go
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Issues -- /rest/api/2/issue
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------

func (c *Client) GetIssue(...) { ... }

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Projects -- /rest/api/2/project
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------

func (c *Client) GetProject(...) { ... }
```

---

## Code Style

### Error handling

Always wrap errors with context. Use `fmt.Errorf("operation: %w", err)` - never discard or swallow errors silently unless documented:

```go
// Good
if err := c.get(ctx, path, &issue); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("get issue %s: %w", key, err)
}

// Bad - no context
if err := c.get(ctx, path, &issue); err != nil {
    return err
}
```

### Logging

`jcli` is a CLI tool, not a server. Do not use a logging framework. Write user-facing messages directly to `os.Stderr` using `fmt.Fprintf`. Reserve `os.Stdout` for command output so it can be piped cleanly.

```go
fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "warning: field %q not found in edit metadata\n", fieldID)
```

Never use the standard `log` package in command or client code.

### Imports

Group imports in three blocks separated by blank lines:
1. Standard library
2. Third-party packages
3. Internal packages (`github.com/steveohara/jcli/...`)

```go
import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/spf13/cobra"

    "github.com/steveohara/jcli/internal/client"
    "github.com/steveohara/jcli/internal/output"
)
```

### Configuration

All user configuration comes from `~/.config/jcli/config.properties`. Use the `cmd.NewClient()` helper to obtain a configured client and resolved output format in every command `RunE` function. Do not read config values directly in leaf commands.

```go
RunE: func(c *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
    cl, cfg := cmd.NewClient()
    ...
}
```

### Concurrency

Use `context.Context` as the first parameter in every function that does I/O. Pass the context received from the Cobra `RunE` function (via `context.Background()`) through to all client calls.

---

## Testing

### Unit tests

Place unit tests alongside the code they test (`foo_test.go` next to `foo.go`). Use table-driven tests for functions with multiple input/output cases. Test names should read as sentences: `TestBuildJQL_FiltersByProjectAndAssignee`.

### Integration / e2e tests

End-to-end tests that make real HTTP calls to a Jira instance must have `//go:build e2e` as the first line and live in `tests/e2e/`. They are excluded from the default `go test ./...` run.

---

## Architecture Rules

These rules encode the key invariants of the system. Never violate them without updating the relevant documentation.

1. **Secrets never in code.** All credentials come from `~/.config/jcli/config.properties` or environment variables. No hardcoded tokens or passwords.
2. **Server/Data Center first.** Target Jira Server / Data Center (`jira.vonage.com`) as the baseline. Cloud-only endpoints must be clearly marked in help text, README, and SKILL.md, with a Server-compatible alternative provided where one exists.
3. **Three-way documentation consistency.** Command help text, README.md, and `.agents/skills/jira/SKILL.md` must always agree. Update all three when adding or changing a command.
4. Never auto-commit or create releases. All changes must be explicitly requested and tagged with a version.
